# pam_rundir: Provide user runtime directory

pam_rundir is a PAM module that can be used to provide user runtime
directory, as described in the XDG Base Directory Specification.

The directory will be created on login (open session) and removed on logout
(close session), and its full path made available in an environment variable,
usually `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.

This fork contains some changes of the original implementation for Artix Linux.
